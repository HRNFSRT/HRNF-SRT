<!-- How We Started Section -->
<section class="how-we-started">
    <h2>How We Started</h2>
    <p>
        The Highrock National Forest Search and Rescue Team was founded in early 2024 in response to a growing need for specialized search and rescue services in Liberty County. As outdoor recreational activities surged in popularity, so did the number of incidents requiring emergency assistance within the picturesque yet challenging terrain of Highrock National Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognizing the limitations of existing resources, the Springfield and River City Fire Departments, alongside the Liberty County Fire Commission, convened to address the increasing demand for a dedicated search and rescue team. Their discussions highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive response capability, especially in scenarios where traditional emergency services struggled to reach individuals in remote and rugged environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        The State Fire Commission also identified the necessity for a specialist rescue team to serve the region effectively. This collaborative effort laid the groundwork for the formation of the Highrock National Forest Search and Rescue Team, bringing together experienced professionals from various backgrounds in emergency services, wilderness survival, and medical support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since our inception, we have been committed to training, equipping, and enhancing our capabilities to respond to a wide range of emergencies. Our team is built on a foundation of teamwork, dedication, and a shared mission to protect and serve our community. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the highest level of care and expertise, ensuring that help is always available for those who explore the beauty of Highrock National Forest.

            <h3>October 20th, Springfield Town, Missing Elderly Person</h3>
<p>
On Tuesday, an elderly resident from a local care home went missing during a walk. Reported missing at 1:36 PM, the Highrock National Forest Search and Rescue Team (HRNF SRT) was called at 6:24 AM Wednesday.

Upon arrival, the team learned that the individual, who suffers from dementia, had not been found despite extensive searches. A police K9 unit identified a scent near a popular hiking trail to Liberty Peak.

The team was quickly divided into two units: one for grid searching the trail and surrounding areas, and another utilizing the K9 to track the scent. At 12:25 PM, the K9 team discovered clothing matching the missing person's description.

Finally, at 2:37 PM, they located the man resting against a tree, approximately 0.5 km from the trail. He reported being lost but expressed a desire to experience the peak one last time. He was safely transported to the hospital via an off-road ambulance, and all units were later released.

Thanks to the swift action and coordination of the HRNF SRT and local authorities, the individual was brought back to safety.
