<!-- How We Started Section -->
<section class="how-we-started">
    <h2>How We Started</h2>
    <p>
        The Highrock National Forest Search and Rescue Team was founded in early 2024 in response to a growing need for specialized search and rescue services in Liberty County. As outdoor recreational activities surged in popularity, so did the number of incidents requiring emergency assistance within the picturesque yet challenging terrain of Highrock National Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognizing the limitations of existing resources, the Springfield and River City Fire Departments, alongside the Liberty County Fire Commission, convened to address the increasing demand for a dedicated search and rescue team. Their discussions highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive response capability, especially in scenarios where traditional emergency services struggled to reach individuals in remote and rugged environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        The State Fire Commission also identified the necessity for a specialist rescue team to serve the region effectively. This collaborative effort laid the groundwork for the formation of the Highrock National Forest Search and Rescue Team, bringing together experienced professionals from various backgrounds in emergency services, wilderness survival, and medical support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since our inception, we have been committed to training, equipping, and enhancing our capabilities to respond to a wide range of emergencies. Our team is built on a foundation of teamwork, dedication, and a shared mission to protect and serve our community. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the highest level of care and expertise, ensuring that help is always available for those who explore the beauty of Highrock National Forest.
